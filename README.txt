I. About Sinphyudaw:

	Sinphyudaw is an eCommerce website for motorcycle helmets.
	I chose to build this project because I am interested in applying my knowledge of python in web development. 
	As I work at a motorcycle helmet company, I have been given permission to use their image assets and database.
	This project has helped me advance in my career as my employer is giving me a project for creating a website to help his company's warehouse operations. 

II. Technologies Used and Why:

	Flask: For the python web framework, I chose Flask because it is flexible and lightweight.
	I tried learning Django but I prefer Flask because Flask gives me better understanding of Python and allows me to choose the extensions that I want. 

	SQLite: For the database, I chose SQLite because it is fast and easy to learn. SQLite also have support for full text search which I have implemented in my project. 
	As I am also taking a class on database design during this semester, it is great to be able to use SQL alongside Python.

	Bootstrap: For front-end, I chose Bootstrap because it has a small learning curve and helps me design the website to look good on all screens. 
	
	Ubuntu: For deployment, I chose to deploy on Linode on an Ubuntu server because it gives me more control over future updates and configuring the server.
	Other technologies that I used for deployment are nginx and gunicorn. I am a beginner with these technologies and had to follow a tutorial article.    


III. Experience on Project:

	Overall, working on this project was challenging and fun. I learn better and more effectively when I am applying my knowledge of Python as I learn. 
	After an attempt to learn C and the concept of pointers, I am grateful that a simple and powerful language like Python exists. 
	One important skill that I gained from this project is the ability to search and find topics I don't understand on the internet. 
	Another thing I learned is that I need to learn JavaScript in the future because it is necessary for frontend web development. 
	For example, I would be able to make use of DOM manipulations and AJAX requests for a better user experience. 
 

III. Most Interesting Topic of Course:
	
	The most interesting topic of this course is the use of object-oriented programming in Python.
	OOP is interesting to me because it encapsulates and represent real word or imaginary objects.
	For example, I used my understanding of objects when I instantiated Flask extensions in my project.
